Game Logic: Designed systems for scoring, letter validation, and turn transitions, ensuring fair play and competitive mechanics.

Save/Load Functionality: Enabled game state persistence via file I/O (output.txt), allowing players to resume sessions.

Localization: Integrated Persian alphabet support for specialized gameplay requirements.

Time Management: Added configurable timers for rounds and turns, with visual feedback for players.

UI Components: Utilized JavaFX for responsive buttons, modals, and alerts, enhancing user experience.

Technologies: Java, JavaFX, Networking (Socket Programming), File I/O, Event-Driven Design.
